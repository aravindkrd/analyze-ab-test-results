# Analyze-AB-Test-Results

This repository contains the project submission for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 3 - Analyze-AB-Test-Results. The project focuses on analyzing a dataset that includes conversion rates between a new and old website for an e-commerce company. The goal is to apply statistical techniques learned in the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree course to perform an A/B test and provide insights on whether the company should implement the new page, keep the old one, or continue running the experiment. 

## Project Description

The project demonstrates the practical application of statistics learned in the course. By working through the provided notebook, the analysis aims to help the community make an informed decision about the effectiveness of the new website design. The dataset will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods and hypothesis testing to provide valuable insights and recommendations.

Please refer to the project's notebook for detailed analysis steps, data exploration, statistical calculations, and conclusions.
